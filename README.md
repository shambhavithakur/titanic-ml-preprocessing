# Predicting the Survival of Titanic Passengers

## Preprocessing and model training

In this project, I preprocessed data from a [Kaggle repository](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) and trained machine-learning models to predict whether specific passengers of the Titanic survived or not. A random-forest classifier with parameters selected through grid search (GridSearchCV) provided the most accurate results.
